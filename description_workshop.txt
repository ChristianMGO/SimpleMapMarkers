[h2]How to use[/h2]

Go in your Controls configuration, and set the keybinds to your preference.

Press P (Default keybind) to create a marker at your current position.
Or open the fullscreen map and right click (Mouse2, default keybind) where you want to create a marker.

On the Create Marker menu, type a name, select an icon and choose whether or not you want the marker to be public, then click on Confirm. (Public is used in multiplayer, makes it so everyone in the server can see the marker)

To delete a marker you need to hover it and press the scrollwheel (Mouse3, default keybind)

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]

- In rare occasions, you are unable to delete your own public marker.
